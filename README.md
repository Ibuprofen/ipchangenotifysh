ipchangenotify
==============

Tiny script to email when ip address changes. When you're too cheap for one of ddclient's supported dynamic dns providers! Not useful if you have frequent IP address changes.


### Install
1. Clone
2. Config
3. Setup cronjob `0 * * * * sh /path/to/ipchangenotify.sh` to check once an hour
